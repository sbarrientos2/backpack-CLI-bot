## Risk Management

The bot includes built-in risk management:

### Position Sizing

The bot will reject orders that:
- Exceed maximum position size (set in config)
- Exceed portfolio risk percentage
- Would over-leverage your account

### Risk Parameters

Configure in `.env`:

```env
MAX_POSITION_SIZE=1000    # Max $1000 per position
RISK_PERCENTAGE=1.0       # Risk 1% of portfolio per trade
```

### Stop Losses

While the bot doesn't automatically place stop losses, you should:

1. Calculate stop loss price before entering
2. Set mental stop loss
3. Manually close position if hit
4. Or place stop-limit orders separately

**Example:**
- Entry: $100
- Stop loss: $98 (2% risk)
- Position size: Based on risk tolerance

## Position Management

### Monitoring Positions

- Positions table shows real-time PnL
- Green = profitable, Red = losing
- Entry price vs current mark price
- Percentage gain/loss

### Closing Positions

To close a position:
1. Use market sell (for long) or market buy (for short)
2. Enter quantity equal to your position size
3. Position closes and PnL realizes

### Partial Closes

You can close portions of positions:
- Close 50% by selling half your quantity
- Scale out at different price levels
- Take profits while maintaining exposure

## Trading Strategies
